/*
 * All the mathemtical idea of the sampler is taken from
 * Lawrence93, i.e
 *
 * Lawrence, Altschul, Boguski, Liu, Neuwald and Wootton (1993)
 * Detecting Subtle Sequence Signals: A Gibbs Sampling
 * Strategy for Multiple Alignment, Science 262:208-214
 *
 * There are two kinds of sampler activity: LocalGibbsStep and PositionAdjustment.
 * Here is the description of LocalGibbsStep.
 * One pattern is current of every step.
 * From all other patterns, we count probability for
 * a letter j to be in position i in a pattern and
 * probability p for it to be in nonpattern space.
 *
 * Than, we count a_i=mult(q_i_j/p_i) along all letters of the pattern.
 *
 * Than, we create y_i=non-normalised vector of a_i.
 *
 * Calculation of Y_i is made by the routine calculate_position_weights()
 *
 * Then, we generate the new pattern i in current sequence from y_i vector by
 * get_int_draw_from_a_ditribution().
 *
 * One of PositionAdjustment or PositionAndLengthAdjustment (we will call it
 * Adjustment) is made once in  :
 * 		(sequence_number*local_cycles_between_global_adjustments),
 * i.e after PositionAdjustment we make local_cycles_between_global_adjustments
 * cycles of LocalGibbsStep and then make the Adjustment.
 * Both Adjustment and LocalGibbsStep shifts the current pattern,
 * so Adjustment happens  every time with new current_sequence.
 *
 * local_cycles_between_global_adjustments=0 in constructor means that we
 * count automatically.
 *
 * Is counts the weight af all possible shifts of all patterns except current
 * sticked in a as a solid bunch and then generates the shift of the bunch from
 * the weights. We just maximise the weight by shifting the bunch.
 * It is more effective, but we cannot gather any statistics other
 * than between two PositionAdjustment. When we adjust length, we count the
 * best shift for every length and than compare Information_per_pattern_position
 * for every length, finding the best.
 *
 * Here, we write sampler devoted to DNA text sampling (we always suggest that
 * compements do make sense). To test protein sequences, we can put line
 * complements_are_possible=0 to configuration file.
 *
 *
 * The sampler has two stages of work : annealing (looking for smth sesible)
 * which is done only by local steps and maximising where we suppose
 * nothins about the motifs, they can find their lenght and presence them-
 * selves.
 * The test for annealing is over is: scalar products of the states before
 * and after  annealing_is_over_test_cycles (default 2) sequential cycles
 * of local samling are not less than for sequential_states_product
 * (default 0.5).
